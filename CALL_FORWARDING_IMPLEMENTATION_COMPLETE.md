# Call Forwarding Implementation - COMPLETE

## Overview

The call forwarding system has been successfully implemented in the RankandRentProUIv2 application. This implementation provides a complete call forwarding system that allows users to:

1. **Choose a phone number they own** from their existing phone numbers
2. **Set up forwarding to another phone number** with proper validation
3. **Configure forwarding behavior** (always, busy, no answer, unavailable)
4. **Manage forwarding settings** through a modern React interface
5. **Toggle forwarding on/off** with real-time status updates
6. **View and edit existing rules** in a comprehensive table format
