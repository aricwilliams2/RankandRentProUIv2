## 💻 Technical Implementation

### **Data Flow**
```
Backend API → Context Transformation → Component Display → User Interaction
```

1. **Backend returns** call logs with `call_sid`, `from_number`, `to_number`, etc.
2. **Context transforms** to `callSid`, `from`, `to` for frontend consistency
3. **Components display** with proper formatting and controls
4. **Users interact** with recordings via professional audio player

### **API Integration**
```typescript
// Fetches call history from your backend
const response: CallHistoryApiResponse = await twilioApi.getCallLogs();

// Expected backend format:
{
  "success": true,
  "callLogs": [
    {
      "id": 3,
      "call_sid": "CAcafb183ea07741514d4e100aed2b1618",
      "from_number": "+17122145838",
      "to_number": "+19102002942",
      "status": "completed",
      "direction": "outbound-api",
      "duration": 33,
      "price": "0.0085",
      "recording_url": "https://api.twilio.com/recordings/...",
      "recording_status": "completed"
    }
  ]
}
```
