# 🎯 Enhanced Number Purchasing with Smart Fallbacks

Your frontend now handles the smart number purchasing system where Twilio may assign a different number if the requested one is unavailable.

## 🔄 How It Works

### Backend Response Structure
Your backend now returns detailed information about number purchases:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "phoneNumber": {
    "id": 2,
    "phone_number": "+18745551235",
    "user_id": 3,
    "friendly_name": "Auto-assigned Number",
    // ... other fields
  },
  "requestedNumber": "+18745551234",
  "isDifferentNumber": true,
  "message": "The requested number was unavailable. Assigned closest alternative."
}
```

### Frontend Handling
The frontend now provides a rich user experience:

## 🎨 User Experience

### Scenario 1: Exact Number Available ✅
**User clicks on**: `+18745551234`
**Result**: 
- ✅ **Success Dialog**: "Number Successfully Purchased!"
- 🟢 **Shows**: "Your New Number: +18745551234 (Exactly what you requested!)"
- ✅ **Snackbar**: "Successfully purchased +18745551234!"

### Scenario 2: Different Number Assigned ⚠️
**User clicks on**: `+18745551234` 
**Twilio assigns**: `+18745551235`
**Result**:
- ⚠️ **Warning Dialog**: "Number Assignment Changed"
- 🔴 **Shows**: "Requested Number: +18745551234 (This number was already taken)"
- 🟢 **Shows**: "Assigned Number: +18745551235 (Your new phone number)"
- ℹ️ **Info**: "Don't worry! Twilio found you the best available alternative..."
- ⚠️ **Snackbar**: "The number +18745551234 was taken. We got you +18745551235 instead."

## 💻 Implementation Details

### 1. **Enhanced Types**
```typescript
export interface BuyNumberResponse {
  success: boolean;
  phoneNumber: PhoneNumber;
  requestedNumber: string;
  isDifferentNumber: boolean;
  message: string;
}
```

### 2. **Smart Purchase Logic**
```typescript
const response = await userPhoneNumbers.buyPhoneNumber({
  phoneNumber: selectedNumber,
  country: 'US',
  areaCode: '874'
});

if (response.isDifferentNumber) {
  // Show warning with both numbers
  showWarning(`Requested ${response.requestedNumber}, got ${response.phoneNumber.phone_number}`);
} else {
  // Show success
  showSuccess(`Successfully purchased ${response.phoneNumber.phone_number}!`);
}
```

### 3. **Rich UI Feedback**
