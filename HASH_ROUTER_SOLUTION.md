# HashRouter Solution for SPA Routing

## Problem Solved
- **404 errors on page refresh** in production
- **Direct URL access** not working
- **Browser back/forward** navigation issues

## Solution: HashRouter
Switched from `BrowserRouter` to `HashRouter` to eliminate server-side routing issues.

### What Changed:
1. **App.tsx**: Updated import from `BrowserRouter` to `HashRouter`
2. **URL utilities**: Updated to handle hash-based routing
3. **Removed complex SPA config**: No longer need `_redirects`, `render.yaml`, etc.

### How It Works:
- **HashRouter** uses URL fragments (`#`) for routing
- Example: `https://yoursite.com/#/analytics` instead of `https://yoursite.com/analytics`
- Server only sees the base URL, React Router handles the hash part
- **No server configuration needed** - works on any static hosting

### Benefits:
✅ **No more 404 errors** - Works on any hosting platform  
✅ **Simple deployment** - No special server config required  
✅ **Video sharing works** - Shareable URLs function correctly  
✅ **All features preserved** - Video recording, analytics, etc. all work  
✅ **Cross-platform** - Works on Render, Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.  

### URL Examples:
- Dashboard: `/#/`
- Analytics: `/#/analytics`
- Phone Numbers: `/#/phone-numbers`
- Video Recording: `/#/video-recording`
- Shareable Video: `/#/v/video-id`

### Video Recording Impact:
**None!** Video recording functionality is completely unaffected:
- Recording works exactly the same
- File uploads work the same
- Shareable URLs work (just with `#` in the URL)
- All video features preserved

### Deployment:
Simply build and deploy - no special configuration needed:
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy dist/ folder to any static hosting
```

This is a much simpler and more reliable solution than complex server-side routing configurations!
