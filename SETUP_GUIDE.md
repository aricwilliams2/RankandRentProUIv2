# üöÄ Multi-User Calling Platform Setup Guide

Transform your single-user Twilio app into a multi-user calling platform where each user owns and manages their own phone numbers.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Existing Node.js/React app with Twilio integration
- MySQL/PostgreSQL database
- Twilio account with Account SID and Auth Token
- User authentication system in place

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

### 1. Frontend Updates ‚úÖ

The frontend has been updated with:
- **New Types**: Multi-user phone number and call types
- **Context Provider**: `UserPhoneNumbersContext` for state management
- **Updated API Service**: Multi-user Twilio endpoints
- **Enhanced UI**: User-specific phone number management
- **Security**: User isolation and ownership validation

### 2. Database Migration

Run the provided SQL migration:

```bash
# Apply the database schema changes
mysql -u username -p your_database < database_migration.sql

# Or for PostgreSQL (adapt the SQL as needed)
psql -U username -d your_database -f database_migration.sql
```

**Key Tables Created:**
- `user_phone_numbers` - User-owned phone numbers
- `twilio_calls` - User-specific call logs
- `twilio_recordings` - User-specific recordings

### 3. Environment Variables

Update your `.env` file:

```bash
# REMOVE this line - no longer needed
# TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890

# KEEP these existing variables
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here

# ADD these new variables
TWILIO_APP_SID=APxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  # Create TwiML app in Twilio Console
SERVER_URL=https://your-api-domain.com  # Your API base URL for webhooks
```

### 4. Backend API Implementation

You need to implement the backend endpoints documented in `MULTI_USER_API_ENDPOINTS.md`. Here's a quick overview:

**Required Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/twilio/my-numbers` - Get user's phone numbers
- `POST /api/twilio/buy-number` - Purchase phone number
- `DELETE /api/twilio/my-numbers/:id` - Release phone number
- `POST /api/twilio/call` - Make call with ownership validation
- `GET /api/twilio/call-logs` - Get user's call history
- `GET /api/twilio/recordings` - Get user's recordings

**Key Security Features:**
```javascript
// Example middleware for user isolation
const validatePhoneNumberOwnership = async (req, res, next) => {
  const { phoneNumberId } = req.params;
  const userId = req.user.id;
  
  const phoneNumber = await db.query(
    'SELECT * FROM user_phone_numbers WHERE id = ? AND user_id = ?',
    [phoneNumberId, userId]
  );
  
  if (!phoneNumber) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Phone number not found or not owned by user' });
  }
  
  req.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
  next();
};
```

### 5. Twilio Webhook Configuration

Update your Twilio Console:

1. **TwiML App Configuration:**
   - Create a new TwiML App in Twilio Console
   - Set Voice URL: `https://your-domain.com/webhooks/twilio/voice`
   - Set Status Callback: `https://your-domain.com/webhooks/twilio/call-status`

2. **Phone Number Webhooks:**
   - Each purchased number will automatically use your TwiML App
   - No manual webhook configuration needed per number

### 6. Test the Integration

1. **User Registration/Login:**
   ```bash
   # Test user can access the platform
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" https://your-api.com/api/twilio/my-numbers
   ```

2. **Purchase Phone Number:**
   ```bash
   # Search for available numbers
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
        "https://your-api.com/api/twilio/available-numbers?areaCode=415"
   
   # Purchase a number
   curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"phoneNumber":"+14155551234"}' \
        https://your-api.com/api/twilio/buy-number
   ```

3. **Make a Call:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"to":"+14155559876","from":"+14155551234","record":true}' \
        https://your-api.com/api/twilio/call
   ```

## üîê Security Checklist

- [ ] All API endpoints validate user authentication
- [ ] Users can only see/manage their own phone numbers
- [ ] Call logs are user-isolated
- [ ] Recordings are user-isolated
- [ ] Webhook endpoints validate number ownership
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented for API calls
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints

## üí∞ Billing Integration

### Option 1: Pass-Through Billing
- Users pay Twilio directly
- You track usage for analytics
- Simplest implementation

### Option 2: Platform Billing
- You bill users monthly
- Track Twilio costs per user
- Add your markup/fees
- Integrate with Stripe/payment processor

**Example billing calculation:**
```javascript
const calculateUserBill = async (userId, month) => {
  const calls = await getUserCalls(userId, month);
  const recordings = await getUserRecordings(userId, month);
  const phoneNumbers = await getUserActiveNumbers(userId, month);
  
  const callCosts = calls.reduce((sum, call) => sum + call.price, 0);
  const recordingCosts = recordings.reduce((sum, rec) => sum + rec.price, 0);
  const numberCosts = phoneNumbers.length * 1.00; // $1/month per number
  
  return {
    callCosts,
    recordingCosts,
    numberCosts,
    total: callCosts + recordingCosts + numberCosts
  };
};
```

## üìä Analytics & Monitoring

Track these metrics per user:
- Phone numbers owned
- Calls made/received
- Call duration and costs
- Recordings stored
- Monthly usage trends

**Example analytics query:**
```sql
SELECT 
  u.name as user_name,
  COUNT(upn.id) as phone_numbers,
  COUNT(tc.id) as total_calls,
  SUM(tc.duration) as total_minutes,
  SUM(tc.price) as call_costs,
  COUNT(tr.id) as recordings,
  SUM(tr.price) as recording_costs
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN user_phone_numbers upn ON u.id = upn.user_id
LEFT JOIN twilio_calls tc ON upn.id = tc.phone_number_id
LEFT JOIN twilio_recordings tr ON upn.id = tr.phone_number_id
WHERE tc.start_time >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY u.id;
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Phone number not found"
**Solution:** Ensure the user owns the phone number before making calls

### Issue: "Webhook not receiving calls"
**Solution:** Check TwiML App configuration in Twilio Console

### Issue: "Recordings not appearing"
**Solution:** Verify webhook URLs are accessible and processing correctly

### Issue: "User sees other users' data"
**Solution:** Add user_id filters to all database queries

## üîÑ Migration from Single-User

If migrating from existing single-user system:

1. **Backup existing data**
2. **Run migration script**
3. **Assign existing numbers to default user:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE user_phone_numbers SET user_id = 1 WHERE user_id IS NULL;
   ```
4. **Test with existing user account**
5. **Gradually migrate users to new system**

## üì± Mobile Considerations

For mobile apps:
- Use same API endpoints
- Implement proper token refresh
- Handle offline scenarios
- Cache user's phone numbers locally
- Implement push notifications for incoming calls

## üåê Scaling Considerations

- **Database indexing**: Added in migration script
- **API rate limiting**: Implement per-user limits
- **Caching**: Cache user phone numbers and recent calls
- **Load balancing**: Standard practices apply
- **Monitoring**: Track API usage and response times

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Deploy backend changes** with user isolation
2. **Test thoroughly** with multiple users
3. **Update documentation** for your team
4. **Train support team** on new multi-user features
5. **Plan billing integration** if needed
6. **Consider advanced features**:
   - Team/organization sharing
   - SMS capabilities
   - Advanced call routing
   - White-label solutions
