# Twilio TwiML Fix for Inbound/Outbound Calls

## Problem
The current TwiML webhook only handles **inbound** calls, but browser calls need to be detected and handled differently. Twilio automatically sets the Direction as "inbound" for all calls to the webhook, so we need to detect browser calls by examining the From and Caller fields.

## Current Issue
When making a browser call, the server receives:
```json
{
  "Direction": "inbound",
  "From": "+18776653167", 
  "To": "(910) 755-5577",
  "Caller": "client:user_1755202676388"
}
```

The key indicators of a browser call are:
- `From` contains a phone number (starts with +)
- `Caller` contains a client identity (starts with client:)
- `Direction` is always "inbound" (Twilio's default)

## Solution: Updated TwiML Webhook

The server-side TwiML webhook needs to handle both inbound and outbound calls. Since Twilio automatically sets the Direction, we need to detect browser calls differently:

```javascript
// Updated TwiML webhook handler
app.post('/api/twilio/voice', (req, res) => {
  const { Direction, From, To, Caller, Called } = req.body;
  
  console.log('ðŸ“ž TwiML request received:', {
    body: req.body,
    query: req.query
  });
  
  console.log(`ðŸ“ž Call - Direction: ${Direction}, From: ${From}, To: ${To}, Called: ${Called}, Caller: ${Caller}`);
  
  // Detect browser calls: From is a phone number, Caller is a client identity
  const isBrowserCall = From && From.startsWith('+') && Caller && Caller.startsWith('client:');
  
  if (isBrowserCall) {
    // Browser call from client to phone number
    console.log(`ðŸ“ž Browser call detected: ${From} to ${To}`);
    
    // For browser calls, we want to connect the call directly
    const twiml = new VoiceResponse();
    
    // Connect the call to the destination
    twiml.dial({
      callerId: From, // Use the selected phone number as caller ID
      record: 'record-from-answer',
      recordingStatusCallback: '/api/twilio/recording-callback'
    }, To);
    
    res.type('text/xml');
    res.send(twiml.toString());
  } else if (Direction === 'inbound') {
    // Real inbound call to your phone number
    console.log(`ðŸ“ž Real inbound call received to: ${Called}`);
    
    // Check if this is a known phone number
    const phoneNumber = findPhoneNumber(Called);
    if (phoneNumber) {
      console.log(`ðŸ“ž Known phone number: ${Called}`);
      // Return TwiML for inbound calls
      const twiml = new VoiceResponse();
      twiml.say('Hello! Thank you for calling our business.');
      twiml.pause({ length: 1 });
      twiml.say('Please leave a message after the beep.');
      twiml.record({
        maxLength: 30,
        action: '/api/twilio/recording-callback',
        transcribe: true
      });
      res.type('text/xml');
      res.send(twiml.toString());
    } else {
      console.log(`ðŸ“ž Unknown phone number: ${Called}`);
      // Default response for unknown numbers
      const twiml = new VoiceResponse();
      twiml.say('Hello! Thank you for calling.');
      twiml.pause({ length: 1 });
      twiml.say('This is a Twilio phone system. Goodbye!');
      res.type('text/xml');
      res.send(twiml.toString());
    }
  } else {
    // Handle other directions (outbound-dial, etc.)
    console.log(`ðŸ“ž Other call direction: ${Direction}`);
    const twiml = new VoiceResponse();
    twiml.say('Call processing...');
    res.type('text/xml');
    res.send(twiml.toString());
  }
});
```

## Key Changes

### 1. Direction Detection
- Check `Direction` parameter to determine call type
- Handle `inbound` vs `outbound-api` differently

### 2. Inbound Call Handling
- For inbound calls: Play greeting and record message
- Check if the called number is known
- Provide appropriate business greeting

### 3. Outbound Call Handling  
- For outbound calls: Use `<Dial>` to connect the call
- Set proper `callerId` from the client identity
- Enable recording and status callbacks

### 4. Browser Call Configuration
The browser call should be configured to pass the selected phone number and direction for database tracking:

```javascript
// In BrowserCallComponent.tsx
const conn = await device.connect({
  params: {
    To: toNumber,
    From: selectedFromNumber, // Use selected phone number as caller ID
    Direction: 'outbound-api' // For database tracking (Twilio ignores this)
  }
});
```

## Updated Access Token Configuration

The access token should include both inbound and outbound permissions:

```javascript
// Server-side access token generation
const token = new AccessToken(
  process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID,
  process.env.TWILIO_API_KEY,
  process.env.TWILIO_API_SECRET,
  { identity: userIdentity }
);

// Grant voice permissions for both inbound and outbound
const voiceGrant = new VoiceGrant({
  outgoingApplicationSid: process.env.TWILIO_APP_SID,
  incomingAllow: true, // Allow incoming calls
});

token.addGrant(voiceGrant);
```

## Phone Number Configuration

Each phone number needs to be configured with:

1. **Voice Webhook URL**: `/api/twilio/voice`
2. **HTTP Method**: POST
3. **Primary Handler**: For inbound calls
4. **Fallback Handler**: For error cases

## Testing

### Test Inbound Calls
1. Call your Twilio number from another phone
2. Should hear greeting and be able to leave message
3. Call should be recorded and logged

### Test Outbound Calls  
1. Use browser call interface
2. Call should connect directly to destination
3. Should be treated as outbound call
4. Call should be recorded and logged

## Expected Results

After implementing this fix:

- **Inbound calls** to your numbers will get proper business greeting
- **Outbound calls** from browser will connect directly to destination
- **Call direction** will be correctly identified in logs
- **Recordings** will work for both directions
- **Call logs** will show correct direction and details

## Implementation Steps

1. Update server-side TwiML webhook to handle both directions
2. Configure phone numbers with proper webhook URLs
3. Update access token generation to include both permissions
4. Test both inbound and outbound call scenarios
5. Verify call logs show correct direction and details
